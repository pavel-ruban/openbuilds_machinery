# Openbuilds Machinery (c) Pavel Ruban
I was need to assemble some cnc machines like 3d printer, cnc router for aluminium alloys &amp; laser to exposure photo resist &amp; pcb solder mask.

This repository has some models designed by me with openscad, freecad software. I thought it could be usefull for somebody if needed to design own machine, so it's possible to reuse some models like Derlin wheels, 20x20, 20x40 etc aluminium extrusions  and so on. Please feel free to use & change these models as you need.
